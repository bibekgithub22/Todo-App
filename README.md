## Description

This Todo app is a simple yet effective task management tool built using the fundamentals of JavaScript DOM manipulation. The main objective of this project is to allow users to add tasks to their to-do list and delete them when completed.

Key functionalities include:
- <span style="color: green;">**Adding Tasks:** Users can input a task and add it to their list.</span>
- <span style="color: green;">**Deleting Tasks:** Once a task is completed, it can be removed from the list with ease.</span>

I have also implemented basic CSS to style the app, and added subtle animations using GSAP to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- <span style="color: green;">**Task Management:** Add and delete tasks effortlessly.</span>
- <span style="color: green;">**Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices.</span>
- <span style="color: green;">**Animations:** GSAP is used for smooth and appealing animations.</span>

## Technologies Used

- <span style="color: green;">**CSS:** Basic styling for layout and design.</span>
- <span style="color: green;">**GSAP:** A touch of animation for a dynamic user experience.</span>
