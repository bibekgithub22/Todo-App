# Todo App

## Description

This Todo app is a simple yet effective task management tool built using the fundamentals of JavaScript DOM manipulation. The main objective of this project is to allow users to add tasks to their to-do list and delete them when completed.

Key functionalities include:
- **Adding Tasks:** Users can input a task and add it to their list.
- **Deleting Tasks:** Once a task is completed, it can be removed from the list with ease.

I have also implemented basic CSS to style the app, and added subtle animations using GSAP to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add and delete tasks effortlessly.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works smoothly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Animations:** GSAP is used for smooth and appealing animations.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Core functionality through DOM manipulation.
- **CSS:** Basic styling for layout and design.
- **GSAP:** A touch of animation for a dynamic user experience.
